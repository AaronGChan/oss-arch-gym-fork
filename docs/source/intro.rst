Introduction
============

``Custom Environment`` While, gym environment is primarily designed for applying reinforcement learning algorithms, we show how we can generalize that interface to use it to apply any ML algorithms. 

We show how different ways in which various machine learning techniques have been applied to design specialized hardware. 

Recreating these results and overcoming the challenges of getting to work with complex architecture simulators, its sheer slowness increases the barrier of entry for ML-aided design. 

Hence, ArchGym tries to lower this barrier by advocating for a general interface through which we can apply ML-aided design while being agnostic to type of ML algorithm or the simulator type.
